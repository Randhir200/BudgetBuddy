## When sending data from a client to a server using a GET request, there are several ways to include the data:

### 1. Query Parameters: The most common method, where data is appended to the URL in key-value pairs.
```{{base_url}}/endpoint?key1=value1&key2=value2 ```

### 2. Path Parameters: Data is included directly in the URL path.
``` {{base_url}}/endpoint/value1/value2 ```

### 3. Headers: Although less common for GET requests, you can include data in HTTP headers.
``` JavaScript
axios.get('{{base_url}}/endpoint', {
    headers: {
        'Custom-Header': 'value'
    }
});
```

### 4. Cookies: Data can be sent via cookies, which are automatically included in the request headers.
JavaScript
```
document.cookie = "key=value";
```
Each method has its use cases depending on the nature of the data and the serverâ€™s requirements.
Query parameters are the most straightforward and widely used for GET requests.
